# Customer Lifetime Value Analysis

The **Customer Lifetime Value Analysis** project focuses on analyzing customer acquisition cost, revenue generation, and channel effectiveness using a dataset containing attributes such as customer ID, channel, cost, conversion rate, and revenue. The goal is to gain insights into customer acquisition and revenue metrics to optimize marketing strategies and channel allocation.

## Project Objectives

1. **Visualize Customer Acquisition Cost Distribution**
   - Understand the distribution of customer acquisition costs across different channels using descriptive statistics and visualization techniques.

2. **Visualize Revenue Generated by Customers**
   - Explore the revenue generated by customers and analyze patterns and trends over time or by channel.

3. **Compare Cost of Acquisition Across Channels**
   - Determine which channels are the most and least profitable by comparing the cost of acquisition.

4. **Evaluate Channel Effectiveness in Customer Conversion**
   - Analyze which channels are most effective at converting customers based on the conversion rate.

5. **Calculate Total Revenue by Channel**
   - Calculate and analyze the total revenue generated by each channel to identify the most and least profitable channels.

6. **Calculate Return on Investment (ROI) for Each Channel**
   - Measure the return on investment (ROI) for each channel by comparing the revenue generated against the acquisition cost.

## Key Deliverables

- Visualizations illustrating the distribution of customer acquisition cost and revenue generation.
- Insights into the profitability and effectiveness of different channels in customer acquisition and revenue generation.
- ROI analysis for each channel to optimize marketing spend and resource allocation.
